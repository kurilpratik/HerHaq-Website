      "Women’s experience of the Delhi Metro is shaped by four linked problems. Safety and wayfinding information are inconsistent at entries, exits, and platforms. Security presence thins across time bands, surveillance coverage drops beyond peak hours, emergency signage and access remains inadequate, and several areas in and around stations remain poorly lit. First and last mile links are often weak. Redressal is hindered by unclear SOPs, fragmented reporting channels, limited feedback loops, and low transparency on safety performance.",
